# @geastack/host

Platform service sources for GeaStack native targets: the C++ host layer
between the framework runtime and the device. It defines the host contract
(display, touch and input, timers, storage, networking, audio, camera, media,
images, memory, clock, battery, window, notifications) and ships portable
implementations of the services a platform can share, plus the cross-cutting
runtime services such as diagnostics, app state and display mirroring.

```sh
npm install @geastack/host
```

## How it is used

A target build does not list these sources by hand. It points
`@geastack/core`'s source manifest at this package and receives the sources and
include roots for the platform being built. A new target implements the host
headers it cannot satisfy with the portable sources.

There is no JavaScript entry point; the package exists to be compiled.

Version 0.1.16 adds native ESP32 WebSocket connection headers, paired with the
public constructor options in `@geastack/core` 0.1.41. Headers are applied to both
the ESP-IDF WebSocket client and its owned transport, so bearer authentication
works on the actual HTTP upgrade request. Existing URL and subprotocol-only
connections retain their defaults.
