// Digital pins, and a single-wire addressable LED strand.
//
// A board with no display still has to be able to say something. Until now the
// only outputs an app could reach were the panel and the log, which left a bare
// module — the exact hardware headless support was added for — with nothing it
// could drive. These two are the smallest primitives that fix that: a pin you
// can set, and the RGB LED that is the one output almost every devkit ships.
//
// Platforms without the hardware implement these as no-ops that report failure,
// so an app written against them still runs everywhere; it simply lights
// nothing. `ok` is therefore "this board did it", not "the call was valid".
